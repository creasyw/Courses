(* Dan Grossman, Coursera PL, HW2 Provided Tests *)

(* These are just two tests for problem 2; you will want more.

   Naturally these tests and your tests will use bindings defined 
   in your solution, in particular the officiate function, 
   so they will not type-check if officiate is not defined.
