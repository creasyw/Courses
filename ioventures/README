Question Description

You are given a prefix expression. Write a program to evaluate it.
Input

The first argument will be an input file with one prefix expression per line. e.g.

* + 2 3 4

Your program has to read this and insert it into any data structure you like. Traverse that data structure and evaluate the prefix expression. Each token is delimited by a whitespace. You may assume that the only valid operators appearing in test data are '+','*' and '/'

Print to stdout, the output of the prefix expression, one per line. e.g.

20
