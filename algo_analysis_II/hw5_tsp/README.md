### Question 1
In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the traveling salesman problem, such as the dynamic programming algorithm covered in the video lectures. File tsp.txt is an instance. The first line indicates the number of cities. Each city is a point in the plane, and each subsequent line indicates the x- and y-coordinates of a single city.

The distance between two cities is defined as the Euclidean distance --- that is, two cities at locations (x,y) and (z,w) have distance ((x−z)^2+(y−w)^2)^0.5 between them.

In the box below, type in the minimum cost of a traveling salesman tour for this instance, rounded down to the nearest integer.
