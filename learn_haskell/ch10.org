* Functionally Solving Problems

It really helps to first think what the type declaration of a function should be before concerning ourselves with the implementation and then write it down. In Haskell, a function's type declaration tells us a whole lot about the function, due to the very strong type system.

we're going to solve a problem in three steps:

1. Forget Haskell for a minute and think about how we'd solve the problem by hand
2. Think about how we're going to represent our data in Haskell
3. Figure out how to operate on that data in Haskell so that we produce at a solution
